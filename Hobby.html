	<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
	<h2>Type of Hobbies:</h2>
	<p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>
	<p>Usually I will do some streaming when I don't have anything to do at home. Sometimes I streaming while I'm playing games or when I'm doing some coding like creating a launcher.</p>

	<li><strong>Coding for fun</strong></li>
	<p>When I learned something new about coding especially in Java or python, usually I create something for my own benefit where I can use it daily such as a launcher for all of my games.</p>
	<li><strong>Fixing a unworking hardware</strong></li>
	<p>Eventhough I'm still learning about hardware troubleshooting, I like to fix an item where someone who owns the items thinks it's already broken</p>
