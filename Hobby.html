	<h2>Type of Hobbies:</h2>
	<p>●<strong>Streaming</strong></p>
	<p>Usually I will do some streaming when I don't have anything to do at home. Sometimes I streaming while I'm playing games or when I'm doing some coding like creating a launcher.</p>

	<p>●<strong>Coding fo fun</strong></p>
	<p>When I learned something new about coding especially on Java or python, usually from that material, I create something for my own benefit where I can use it daily uses such as a launcher for all of my games.</p>
	<p>●<strong>Fixing an unworking hardware</strong></p>
	<p>Eventhough I'm still learning about hardware troubleshooting, sometimes I like to fix an item where lots of people that the hardware is already broken and cannot be fixed anymore.</p>
